## A Simple Rails Template focused on Front End Development

Try it out by running:
`rails new YOUR_APP_NAME -m https://raw.github.com/tbonemalone/simple-rails-template/master/base_template.rb`


### Here is what you'll get
- Adds compass-rails and haml-rails to GEMFILE
  - So now newly generate 'html' files will be `haml` instead of `erb`
- Sets default Sass syntax to sass instead of scss
- Creates a new compass project (with .sass extensions)
- Removes ie.css.sass and print.css.sass files generated by compass.
- Grabs a local version of jQuery (just in case)
- Gives you they option to generate a controller.

  If Yes then:
  - Creates an index page in that controller
  - Sets that index page to the root_url
  - Removes public/index.html placholder page

- Creates a git repo, adds all newly created files and commits them.


That's it. No fancy stuff. Just some time saving for us folks who want to throw together a quick project.
